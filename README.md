# smallProjects
just a bunch of small algorithms to sharpen quick programming skills. 
ex:
  a recursive summation

# Lua contents:
### luaCongruence.lua
a lua program that takes a modulus, multiplier, increment, and seed value to find the linear congruency of *n* values.

## eight-queen.lua
prints out every instance of an `n` x `n` board with `n` queens on it where no queen can steal another

## iteration.lua
prints the sum of `n` times every natural number, and stops at a specific integer. created during a discrete mathematics course to help with problem solving

## binaries.lua
determines how many binary numbers there are with length `n` that have at least a pair of consecutive zeros

# C:
### decToHex.c
the main file for a decimal to hexadecimal conversion calculator. this project is really an introduction to hash-maps in C, though. 

### dictionary.c
this is where I am building the functions that will create and utilize hash maps. controls dictionary size, contents, and accessibility. 

### dictionary.h
just your average, everyday header file. contains declaration of the structures used, function templates, etc. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

# x86 Assembly:
### kv.s
Trying to build a dictionary in x86 assembly. Ultimately, I'm going to build a decimal-to-hexadecimal binary, but I need to start with having a solid dictionary that works in x86. 

### testkv.s
Not that it would ever happen, but whenever `kv.s` gets a segmentation fault, I throw snippets of code in here to get a better idea of where things are breaking. This file won't contribute to any main projects, it exists for debugging purposes. Not that GDB isn't amazing!
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Python:
### recursion.py
just a demo of recursion to explain it to someone like they're five
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Brain F*ck:
<br>
### hello.bf
don't judge me, please. i saw a youtube video.
